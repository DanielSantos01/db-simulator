# db_simulator
A simple program developed by using Ruby programming language

# Description
By running this application you will have access to a menu,
containing three options (at the moment):
1) Add users: This option will let you add as users you want to the "database",
informing the name and the role of the user;
2) Query users: As you create some user, now you can query on "database" for a specific
user, informing the key (name, role or id) and the value that you wants to match.
3) Exit application: This option will end the app execution.

# More Info
- The idea is to practice the use of Ruby programming language, that i'm learning at this moment;
- Probably new functions will be added later, like update an user, delete, put optional fields, etc.
